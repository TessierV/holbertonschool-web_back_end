# overview
This project focuses on advanced Python concepts related to type annotations, specifying function signatures, variable types, duck typing, and using Mypy for code validation. It aims to enhance your understanding of Python 3's typing system and how to leverage type annotations for more robust code.

0. Basic annotations - add
1. Basic annotations - concat
2. Basic annotations - floor
3. Basic annotations - to string
4. Define variables
5. Complex types - list of floats
6. Complex types - mixed list
7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple
8. Complex types - functions
9. Let's duck type an iterable object

advanced
10. Duck typing - first element of a sequence
11. More involved type annotations
12. Type Checking
